## Project Description
My neighbor in Lisbon performed Flamenco dances in the streets of Lisbon. The project was about testing some hypotheses regarding what drives the return of a  street performaner.

<a name="hypotheses-/-questions"></a>

## Hypotheses / Questions
- Old individual men donate more?
- Gender 'study' (male vs. female vs. couples).
- Number of stops has a positive effect on return?
- Location matters?
- Songs matter?

<a name="dataset"></a>

## Dataset
The dataset contains 50 observations including two outliers of:
- 6 groups (time slots of 20 min each)
- 2 locations [Baixa-Chiado, Praça do Comércio]
- Genders [Male, Female, Couples]
- Individuals [True/False]
- Age Group [25-49, 50+]
- Songs (4 out of 5 songs)
- Return in EUR
